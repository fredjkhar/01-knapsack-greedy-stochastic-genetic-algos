## EMPIRICAL STUDY OF THE KNAPSACK PROBLEM

This project focuses on the classic Knapsack Problem, specifically on exploring and testing various search algorithms.

### Algorithms
* Greedy Search Algorithm: A heuristic-based approach that makes locally optimal choices at each stage with the hopes of finding a global optimum.
* Simulated Annealing: A probabilistic technique used for approximating the global optimum of a given function. For this problem, the adaptation would be flipping a bit (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) to determine if an item is included in the knapsack or not.
* Genetic Algorithm: A heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that reflects the process of natural evolution. This algorithm combines crossover, mutation, and selection for optimization.

### Key Outcomes
A deep dive into experimental approaches required to compare the above-mentioned three search algorithms and report comparative (interesting) results.
